My side project / game (Latest APK versions of the game)

Latest Patch Notes (V0.015):
- Made audio come from both sides of the screen, volume being dependant on distance from player (do you guys like this or not? i can't make my mind up)
- Added a new coin type and changed around the coin values and spawn chance 
- Optimised the background image to fit any screen (hopefully... tablet compatible?? maybe)

There will be a survey on surveymonkey up tomorrow (26th sep 2018 hopefully) to ask you about the current build of the game and your thoughts/ideas. There will be a email tomorrow with the link to the survey.

For those that can't install it or are having issues i have sent you a separate email with guidelines to potentially solving your problem. If anyone else is having issues or game breaking bugs let me know either by emailing me or creating a new issue for this project on github.
