My side project / game (Dev Log)

Latest Patch Notes (V0.1); (still in development, more will be added to this version before exporting and sending to beta testers)
- Audio changes include; stereo pan from left to right ear depending on distance from the sides of the screen, audio fade out upon death, a random song selector function at the start of the game to change between different songs
- Inceases the characters movement speed to be more in sync with the player's finger && made the movement smoother
- Enemy and coin spawn rate scales with time = more enemies and coins spawn the further you get into the game

Latest Patch Notes (V0.02);
- Made audio come from both sides of the screen, volume being dependant on distance from player (do you guys like this or not? i can't make my mind up)
- Added a new coin type and changed around the coin values and spawn chance 
- Optimised the background image to fit any screen (hopefully... tablet compatible?? maybe)
